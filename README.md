# catalogue-of-Pets
Building a single page application(SPA) that has two pages i.e list of pets and details about specific pet i.e Name, Breed, Location, and Description. User can filter through the list by animal type, gender and size, and select favorite Pet to Adopt. 

I acquired the [petFinder API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@petfinder/petfinder-js) and [Front-end Master's [pet API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frontendmasters/pet) through npm and for the API Keys through the petFinder [documentation](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/) where one can request for API key and secret key.
